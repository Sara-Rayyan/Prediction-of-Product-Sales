# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

This project is part of a data science portfolio aimed at showcasing skills and competencies to potential employers. The focus of this project is on predicting sales for food items sold at various stores. 
  - From the product side, factors such as fat content, item type, visibilit, and product weight are analyzed to understand their influence on sales.
  - From the outlet side, attributes like outlet size, location, and type are considered to capture differences in consumer behavior across different store settings.
By combining these two dimensions, the project provides insights into what drives higher sales and offers a tool to forecast sales more accurately.

**ðŸ“ŒThe goal:**
---
